# Snake-2D

Snake 2D is a small game that I coded on my own. It's an arcade game where you control a snake that is eating food and growing up. Your role is to lead the snake in the right direction of food and not to bump into obstacles. I wrote a custom engine for it using Windows SDK. It was quite a challenge for me. I have learned a lot of things while developing. The most important thing that I learned is how to create a component based framework. Although the game is written on my custom engine I have not given it any name yet, because it's not fully workable and contains a lot of issues that need to be resolved. But its potential was enough to create a tiny game such as snake.

​Things I've learned.
​Component Based Architecture
​Graphics/rendering pipeline
How to create GUI System
​2D Transformation Matrices
​Level Management
​Serialization (Saving/Loading data)
Handling user input
​2D Collision detection
​Memory management
